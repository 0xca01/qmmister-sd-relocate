# qmmister-sd-relocate
Simple PCB to enable relocation of microSD card slot on the QMTech MiSTer board. Tested and working - recommend 0.6mm board as the minimum stack height to clear the SMD resistors. J1 flex connector on the MiSTer board needs to be removed. A 50mm 9 pin flex cable (0.5mm pitch) connects the two halves.
